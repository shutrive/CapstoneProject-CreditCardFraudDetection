# CapstoneProject-CreditCardFraudDetection
Suppose you get a call from your bank, and the customer care executive informs you that your card is about to expire in a week. Immediately, you check your card details and realise that it will expire in the next eight days. Now, to renew your membership, the executive asks you to verify a few details such as your credit card number, the expiry date and the CVV number. Will you share these details with the executive?


In such situations, you need to be careful because the details that you might share with them could grant them unhindered access to your credit card account.
 
In this module, you will understand frauds from a bank’s perspective and learn about the extent to which these frauds affect their business. Banks need to be cautious about their customers’ transactions, as they cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank, as the bank is responsible for the fraudulent transactions if they are reported within a certain time frame by the customer.

 

In the next video, you will learn about the importance of this project and develop the business understanding required.
